This was a game I created through a tutorial by the Youtuber named "Brackeys"

The main tutorial Youtube playlist is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL

I also was able to deploy it to the Windows Enviornment using Inno Setup Compiler which I got from here: http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

Brackeys also gave a tutorial on how to deploy it to Windows, Mac and WebGL here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nxKAtxGSn8

Feel free to branch the game and do what you wish.
